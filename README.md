# Challenge09 - README Generator


<h1>Description</h1><br>
Hello and welcome to challenge number 9 where the task was to create a README generator using node. When I would put the command node index.js in the terminal, it will ask you a series of questions and your answers would be put into their respected sections for a README. Once all questions are answered, a new README file will be created as you will see in the files.
